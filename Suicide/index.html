<h1>Suicide - A Worldwide Problem! 1986-2013</h1>   
<h2> </h2>  
<h3>Our tool will help and work for people who care or focus on researching suicide to find the relations between those 
    factors that made people suicide.</h3> 
<h3>Our factors include countries, years, gender, age, population and GDP.</h3> 
<h3>The tool shows us the information about Top 10 countries every year, the changing number about every country and gender.</h3>

<h3>1. Top 10 countries with the highest suicides number per 100K people population.</h3>

<h3>Limitations：</h3>
<h3>1.For the most curious thing, we found there were always children between 5-14 suicide, up to now, by our factors, we cannot imagine the reeson except poverty and violence, but we believe there must be other reasons.</h3>
<h3>2.For part 1, if we put the countries' flags, it will be more clear.</h3>
<h3>3.For the factor like GDP, we don't want to put every GDP on the map or the chart, it will be a mess, so we haven't known how to show it better.</h3>
<h3>4.Finally，we want to try a Zoomable Sunburst to merge more factors together, but haven't had a idea about what should put on.</h3>
